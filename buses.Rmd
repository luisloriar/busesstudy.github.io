These are the results of a DCE study looking at preferences for bus services in Aberdeen. Respondents were asked to choose between 3 services: two hypothetical bus services and their current one. 
Bus services were described in terms of frequency, comfort level, punctuality, driver friendliness, greenhouse gas emissions, local pollutant emissions and fare.

Table 1 shows the results of a conditional logit model.


```{r cars}
results <- read.csv(file = "./results.csv", head = TRUE, sep=",")
rownames(results) <- results[,1]
results[,1] <- NULL
results %>%
  kable(caption = "Table 1. Conditional logit results") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","responsive"),full_width = F)
```
